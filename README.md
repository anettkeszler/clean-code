# clean-code

- Book: Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
- use maningful names 
- a good variable name will tell you exactly what it is being stored in it
- don't include type in the variable , e.g. float floatCatWeightInKg 
- avoid using single character variable names, exept 'i' in for loop
- some naming conventions: 
      for variable names use camelCase (thisIsAVariable)
      class name should also be with CamelCase but with the first letter of class name capitalized (class ThisIsAClass)
      for enum all caps, with multiple words separated by underscore (THIS_IS_AN_ENUM)
      constant should be all with capitalized letters
      class name and variable name should be nouns 
      methods should usually be a verb or a verb phrase and the name should tell you what the method does (e.g. saveCat --> this method saves a Cat type to the DB)
      
 - a method should only be doing only one thing, that should make naming them pretty straightforward. If you are having trouble giving your method a simple name it might mean that your method is doing too much and needs to be broken up
